```{r}
data <- read.table("combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

data %>%
  filter(country == "Italy") %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) -> italy


plot(x=italy$year, y=italy$gdpPercap, xlab="year", ylab="GDP", main = "Italy GDP")

```

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(country == "United States") %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) -> us

plot(x=us$year, y=us$gdpPercap, xlab="year", ylab="GDP", main = "US GDP")
```

The US and Italy are very similar.

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(country == "China") %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) -> china

plot(x=china$year, y=china$gdpPercap, xlab="year", ylab="GDP", main="China GDP")
```

China takes *longer* for its GDP to climb than the other two countries.
